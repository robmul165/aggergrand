      <p>👩‍🌾<strong>Gardeners</strong> Dozens of gardeners have purchased our soils tests and used our recommendations to grow better plants more sustainably.
         By giving one on one consultations while going above and beyond our research on what you should do, we strive to give accurate answers to your 
         growing area needs.</p>

        We tested the soil and found high levels of arsenic. We provided a necessary remediation plan.</p>

        routines as well as give classes and demonstrations about soil health.</p>
