    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>We are a small team of passionate and experienced gardeners. Our mission is to harness artificial intelligence to create the AG Model‚Äîa system that accurately predicts optimal growing practices and maintenance for specific regions. We aspire to evolve into an ecosystem management software platform. We believe that healthy soil is the cornerstone of a thriving ecosystem. Soil is a remarkably complex subenvironment, teeming with diverse microorganisms and minerals that work together to nurture robust, sprawling root systems.</p>

    <h1>Our Work</h1>
    <p>We have conducted extensive soil testing and remediation plans for various clients, helping them better understand and manage their soil health.</p>
    <h3>Case Studies</h3>
    <ul>
      <p>üå± <strong>Church Soil Remediation:</strong> We tested soil for a church and discovered high levels of arsenic. We provided both a traditional remediation plan and a <strong>bioremediation strategy</strong> using plants that absorb arsenic.</p>

      <p>üåæ <strong>Certified Organic Farms in Central Jersey:</strong> We've worked with organic farms to <strong>educate and test their soil</strong>, helping them optimize nutrient use while staying within organic farming guidelines.</p>
      
      <p>üèõ <strong>Rutgers Environmental Stewards Program:</strong> We are actively engaged with Rutgers' program, furthering our knowledge and contributing to community soil management initiatives.</p>
    </ul>
